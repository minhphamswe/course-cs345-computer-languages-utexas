;;;; Homework 2 - Problem 1:
;;;; In the answer to Problem 59 in DeLong’s book, Howard gives the functions for
;;;; primitive recursive exponentiation. Implement these functions in lisp in a
;;;; manner similar to what’s on page 11 of the PLAI1 class notes for primitive
;;;; recursive addition (i.e., f5). In the let statement for the solution show
;;;; that 2^10 = 1024.
;;;; Note: By the way, you should see that f9 is multiplication.
