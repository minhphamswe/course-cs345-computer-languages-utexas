;;;; Homework 2 - Problem 3:
;;;; In a manner similar to problem 2, implement the functions for primitive
;;;; recursive “less than” and in the let statement for the solution build a
;;;; list that shows that 11 < 12, 11 !< 11, and 12 !< 11. i.e., the let should
;;;; return '(0 1 1).
;;;; Hint – see DeLong problem number 60.
