;;;; Homework 2 - Problem 2:
;;;; On pages 158 and 159 in DeLongâ€™s book, Howard gives the functions for
;;;; primitive recursive equality. Implement these functions in lisp in a
;;;; manner similar to problem 1 above. In the let statement for the solutions
;;;; build a list that shows that 11 = 11, 11 != 12, and 12 != 11. i.e., the
;;;; let should return '(0 1 1).

(letrec ((pred (lambda (x) (if (= x 0)
                               0          ; only works for x > 0
                               (- x 1)))) ; x-1 (predecessor fn)
         ; hf-minus (half-minus) is 
         (hf-minus (lambda (x y) (if (= y 0)
                                     x
                                     (pred (hf-minus (x (pred y)))))))
